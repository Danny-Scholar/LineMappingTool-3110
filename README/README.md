# LineMappingTool‑3110  
A line‑level source code mapping tool for COMP‑3110, developed by **Daniel Odoh**, **Seun Samuel‑Ipaye**, and **Ronard Addo**.

This tool compares two versions of Java source files and generates:
- `.out` text reports (side‑by‑side diff style)
- `.xml` structured mapping files
- Optional bug‑related annotations (`bugRelated="true"`) for bonus marks
- Visual line mapping using a GUI viewer
